# ML Checkins

Pluses:
- Hiring a Data Science intern for this summer. Going well. Have a potential hire. 
- Our comms analysis around emails is going well and we are learning a lot. We are trying to figure out how to engage users with a lot of activity with no author follows or interests. Maybe do something with infered interests. 

Deltas: 
- Last semester and it's just a lot of work with two courses. 
- Sick kid. 
- Transactional vs product emails and labeling.

- Look into infered interests model for targetting users. VAE model.
